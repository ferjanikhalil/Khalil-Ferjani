🧠 About Me
I’m a curious and driven  student with hands-on experience in full-stack development. I’ve developed academic and internship projects that showcase my ability to integrate software  development with practical innovation.

Recently, I completed an AI Study Helper web application, where I integrated intelligent features to assist students with studying, task organization, and learning support. The project involved building a full web interface and connecting it with AI-powered tools for text understanding, question generation, and smart recommendations.
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in web development, API integration, and AI-assisted user experiences, gaining deeper insights into how modern AI systems can enhance productivity and education in real-world applications.
