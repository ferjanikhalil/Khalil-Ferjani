## 🧠 About Me
I’m a curious and driven student with hands-on experience in full-stack development. I’ve developed several academic and internship projects that demonstrate my ability to combine software development with practical innovation.

Recently, I completed an **AI Study Helper** web application, where I integrated intelligent features to assist students with studying, organizing tasks, and learning more effectively.  
The project involved building a complete web interface and connecting it with AI-powered tools for text understanding, question generation, and smart recommendations.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in **web development, API integration, and AI-assisted user experiences**, gaining deeper insights into how modern AI can enhance productivity and education.
